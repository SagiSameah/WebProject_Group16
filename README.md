Welcome to our website - Readiculous!
Readiculous is a platform designed for book lovers - to explore new books, discuss, rate them and receive personal recommendations.
Our mission is to create social network that connects people through their love of books.

Our project consists of HTML, CSS and JS files, designed for providing the users the best experience they can get.

General overview of the website:
The name of the website 'Readiculous' is presented in every page, as well as the navigation bar for the users comfort to navigate through the website's pages.
There's also the Readiculous trademake at the bottom of each page, and in some of the pages an occasional quote from a famoues author.

Breakdown of the website's pages:

Registration page - This is the first page a new user sees. In this page the user needs to enter their data (email, first and last name, a birthdate and a password).
The system validates the data the the user entered (for example a birthdate can't be before 1900 or after 2021) and if all the entered data is valid - a new user is created and they are redirected to the home page.

Home page - In the home page the user is introduced to the recommended books the website has found for them, according to their perferences. They can easily toggle through the books with a right and left arrow. When clicking on a book icon, the user is redirected to the book's page (detailed below).

Login page - In this page the user is requested to enter an email address and a password (which must contain at least 8 characters, one capitalcase letter, one lowercase). They also have the option to be redirected to the registration page, in case they're a new user.

It contains info regarding the author, publisher, publishing year, genre, pages, overall rating of the book (rated by the users of the website), number of ratings the book received and they also have the option to rate the book by themselves (1-5 stars).
