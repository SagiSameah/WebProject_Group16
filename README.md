Welcome to our website - Readiculous!
Readiculous is a platform designed for book lovers - to explore new books, discuss, rate them and receive personal recommendations.
Our mission is to create social network that connects people through their love of books.

Our project consists of HTML, CSS and JS files, designed for providing the users the best experience they can get.

General overview of the website:
The name of the website 'Readiculous' is presented in every page, as well as the navigation bar for the users comfort to navigate through the website's pages.
There's also the Readiculous trademake at the bottom of each page, and in some of the pages an occasional quote from a famoues author.
